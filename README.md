# ACGRayMarchCuda
**Assignment: 02 Advanced Ray Tracing - Part of the Advanced Computer Graphics (ACG) Course for Masters Degree**

ACGRayMarchCuda is a ray marching engine developed for Assignment 02 in the Advanced Computer Graphics course. This project demonstrates the application of C++ and CUDA in achieving parallel processing for ray tracing, incorporating several optimization techniques and rendering features to meet the course's requirements.

## Features

### Parallel Processing on GPU using CUDA
Utilizes NVIDIA CUDA technology for parallel processing on GPUs, enhancing the speed of ray marching calculations.

### Octree Optimization
Employs an Octree data structure for efficient space culling, improving the rendering speed of complex scenes.
